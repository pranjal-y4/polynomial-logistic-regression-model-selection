# Polynomial Logistic Regression – Model Selection & Evaluation

This repository implements a model selection workflow for regularized logistic regression using polynomial feature expansion, with comparative evaluation against kNN and baseline classifiers.

---

## Overview

The project focuses on selecting and evaluating classification models on structured datasets, with particular attention to:
- Regularization strength
- Feature complexity via polynomial expansion
- Robust evaluation under class imbalance

Two datasets are analyzed independently using the same modeling and evaluation pipeline.
